1. On the login screen, pull down the human figure icon and check to launch a virtual keyboard 
2. Launch Settings Manager > Tint2 Manager, deselect any running items, check the two whose name begins with “Touchscreen” and click Apply. This will provide a dock and panel specialized for the touchscreen
3. Adjust scrollbar size as needed in ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css 
4. Use Menu > Appearance > Theme > Appearance in Openbox, or Menu > Appearance > Style in Fluxbox, to select larger titlebar controls.
